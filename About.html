                            <p>Starting at International Billingual School at Hsinchu-Science-Park in Taiwan, my ambition was always to grow up in Taiwan and become a semicondoctor engineer at TSMC, just like my dad. Growing up in Taiwan, my school friends played a really big role in my childhood. We would always play soccer during recess and after school, that was the most memorable and fun time of my life. Just as I thought that life like this could go on forever, my dad told me a devastating news during 4th grade </p>
                            <p>My dad told me that he just got a new job in Kular Lumpar, Malaysia and our whole family will have to move there. I got really depressed, but I had no choice. A while after moving to Malaysia I realized life wasn't as bad I expected. I ended up making alot of new friends from not just different races but different countries also, we would continue playing soccer and doing fun things together everyday. That's when I realized moving to a new place and trying new things isn't as bad as I expected</p>
                            <p>When I started middle school, I told my dad I wanted to move somewhere else to explore sometehing new again. He which came up with the idea of sending me to Hawaii to live with my uncle. After attending Roosevelt Highschool, I met the men that would change my life forever named Kaden Aimoto. Kaden is a highly intellectual and athletic Japanese, he is the apple of my eye and the teasure of my soul. I enjoyed every momemnt we hangout and learn new things in Mr Kam's coding class.</p>
                            <p>Although I have transfered to multiple school and countries, I've met amazing people everywhere who enetertained my life and helped me become a better person and I can't be more grateful for them. I wish I can continue exploring new places and meet new people. </p</td></div>
